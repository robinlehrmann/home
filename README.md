You can also use all the packages like:

- docker
- fireflyiii
- iobroker
- mosquitto
- nginx
- nodejs
- php
- pihole
- zigbee2mqtt

with just a `make provision`

make sure, that you configured the hostname correctly in inventory/home

If you have any suggestions to improve it, feel free to contribute :)
